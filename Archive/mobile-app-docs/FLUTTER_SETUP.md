## Quick Troubleshooting

If you encounter **TLS certificate validation errors** when testing IMAP connections:
- See [NEW_DEVELOPER_SETUP.md § Common Fixes](./NEW_DEVELOPER_SETUP.md#common-fixes) — Norton Antivirus 360 / Email Protection section
- See [README.md § Troubleshooting](./README.md#troubleshooting) for full details

The issue is typically Norton Email Protection intercepting TLS traffic. The solution is to disable Email Protection in Norton 360 > Settings > Security > Advanced.
