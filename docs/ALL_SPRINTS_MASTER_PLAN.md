# All Sprints Master Plan

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for all planned work -- features, bugs, spikes, and Google Play Store readiness items. Used alongside GitHub Issues for sprint planning and backlog management.

**Audience**: Claude Code models planning sprints; User prioritizing future work

**Last Updated**: April 3, 2026 (Backlog refinement)

## How to Maintain This Document

This section describes when and how to update this document during sprint execution. Referenced by SPRINT_EXECUTION_WORKFLOW.md (Phases 2.1, 3.2, 7.7), SPRINT_CHECKLIST.md, SPRINT_PLANNING.md, and SPRINT_RETROSPECTIVE.md.

### When to Update

| Sprint Phase | What to Update |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Phase 2 (Pre-Kickoff)** | Verify "Last Completed Sprint" is current; confirm all items from completed sprint are marked done or removed |
| **Phase 3 (Planning)** | Review "Next Sprint Candidates" for completeness; add any new items found in GitHub Issues; re-prioritize list; move selected items into sprint plan |
| **Phase 7 (Retrospective)** | Update "Past Sprint Summary" table; update "Last Completed Sprint"; remove completed feature/bug detail sections; add new issues discovered during sprint |
| **Backlog Refinement** | Full review of all sections; re-prioritize; add/remove items; verify GitHub Issue alignment |

### Maintenance Rules

1. **One list of incomplete work**: The "Next Sprint Candidates" section is THE single prioritized list. Do not create duplicate tracking elsewhere in this document.
2. **Remove completed work**: When a feature, bug, or spike is completed, remove its detail section from "Feature and Bug Details". History lives in sprint docs (`docs/sprints/`), CHANGELOG.md, and closed GitHub Issues.
3. **GitHub Issue alignment**: Every item in "Next Sprint Candidates" should reference a GitHub Issue number if one exists. Items without issues get issues created when added to a Sprint Plan.
4. **HOLD items last**: Items on HOLD are grouped at the bottom of the candidates list with a brief reason.
5. **Keep it current**: The "Last Updated" date at the top must reflect the most recent edit. Stale content erodes trust in the document.
6. **Minimal history**: Past Sprint Summary is a table of links. No completed feature details, no completed retrospective actions, no completed MVP feature lists.
7. **Detail sections are optional**: Not every candidate needs a detail section. Simple bugs or small features can be fully described in GitHub Issues alone. Only add detail sections for items that need architecture notes, task breakdowns, or context beyond what fits in a GitHub Issue.
8. **Cross-reference integrity**: When updating this document, verify that SPRINT_EXECUTION_WORKFLOW.md and SPRINT_CHECKLIST.md references remain accurate. Both reference this Maintenance Guide by name.

- All variants must run simultaneously without rebuild on same machine/device
- [Detail](#f52-multi-variant-side-by-side-install)

**F53. Add block rule for top-level domain .cc (~0.5h) Priority 60**
- Phase: Core Feature
- Platform: All
- Add `@.*\.cc$` block rule pattern to bundled rules.yaml (mirrors existing `@.*\.ru$` pattern at line 1568)
- Target: Sprint 30
- Quick win, similar to other TLD blocks

- Add a new icon+tooltip to the AppBar actions row
- Needs: icon choice, tooltip/label, navigation target
- Design decision: what action should this trigger? (account management, add account, etc.)

**F55. Screen navigation consistency - linear flow + push/pop icons (~4-6h) Priority 66**
- Phase: UX Improvement
- Platform: All
- Two navigation models: linear scan flow (back returns up chain) and icon navigation (push/pop returns to origin)
- Linear flow: Select Account -> Manual Scan -> Live Scan Results; back buttons return one step up
- Icon navigation: Settings, Scan History, Select Account icons push onto stack; back pops to origin
- Current issues:
  - Results back button uses pushReplacement instead of pop (breaks stack)
  - "Back to Accounts" button on Results skips Manual Scan via popUntil
  - Results -> Manual Scan auto-navigation on scan complete should be push (not pushReplacement)
- Consider: keep "Back to Accounts" as convenience shortcut or remove for consistency?
- Consider: "Scan Again" pushReplacement is correct (avoids stack bloat on repeated scans)
- Consider: does the user need a Select Account icon on Manual Scan and Results screens?
- Related: F54 (add icon to Select Account screen)

## Feature and Bug Details

This section contains detailed specifications for incomplete items only. Completed features have their details in sprint documents and CHANGELOG.md.

### Folder Selectors: Two-Level Listing (F37)

**Status**: New (Sprint 20 testing feedback)
**Estimated Effort**: ~6-8h
**Phase**: Core Feature
**Platform**: All

**Overview**: Update folder selector UI (used by Safe Sender Folder, Deleted Rule Folder, and Default Folders settings) with context-aware behavior: two-level collapsible folders for Default Folders, and flat lists with provider defaults first for Safe Sender and Deleted Rule folder selectors.

**Part A: Default Folders selector (multi-select for scan)**

Two-level collapsible folder tree:

```
INBOX
Bulk Mail
Bulk Email
[Gmail] >              (expandable group, collapsed by default)
    [Gmail]/Trash
    [Gmail]/Spam
    [Gmail]/Sent Mail
    [Gmail]/Drafts
    [Gmail]/All Mail
Notes >                (expandable group)
    Notes/Work
    Notes/Personal
```

- Top-level folders shown flat (INBOX, Bulk Mail, etc.)
- Folders with children shown as expandable groups (chevron icon)
- Only first level of children shown (not grandchildren)
- Collapsed by default -- user expands to see children
- Junk/Trash folders auto-highlighted regardless of nesting depth
- Non-selectable parent containers (e.g., `[Gmail]`) shown as group headers only

**Part B: Safe Sender Folder and Deleted Rule Folder selectors (single-select)**

Flat list with provider default first:

- **Safe Sender Folder**: Provider default safe sender folder listed first (e.g., INBOX), remaining folders alphabetical, no sub-folders
- **Deleted Rule Folder**: Provider default deleted folder listed first (e.g., Trash or [Gmail]/Trash), remaining folders alphabetical, no sub-folders

Provider defaults:
- AOL: Deleted Rule = Trash, Safe Sender = INBOX
- Gmail IMAP: Deleted Rule = [Gmail]/Trash, Safe Sender = INBOX
- Gmail OAuth: Deleted Rule = TRASH, Safe Sender = INBOX
- Yahoo: Deleted Rule = Trash, Safe Sender = INBOX

**Provider-Specific Folder Hierarchies** (research before implementation):
- **Gmail IMAP**: `[Gmail]/` prefix for system folders. Custom labels may also use `/` hierarchy. Separator: `/`
- **AOL**: Flat folder structure (INBOX, Bulk Mail, Bulk Email, Sent, Trash). No sub-folders typically. Separator: `/`
- **Yahoo**: Flat structure similar to AOL (Inbox, Bulk, Sent, Trash, Draft). Separator: `/`
- **iCloud**: May have nested folders. Separator: `/`
- **Custom IMAP**: Unknown hierarchy -- must handle any structure. Separator: varies (usually `/` or `.`)

**Implementation Note**: The path separator varies by provider and is returned by the IMAP server in `listMailboxes()` response. Use `mailbox.pathSeparator` to split paths into parent/child, do not hardcode `/`.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Research and document actual folder hierarchy for each supported provider before implementation
- [ ] Part A: FolderSelectionScreen groups child folders under their parent (Default Folders only)
- [ ] Part A: Parent folders with children show expand/collapse toggle
- [ ] Part A: Groups collapsed by default, only first-level children shown
- [ ] Part A: Non-selectable parent containers cannot be selected, only expanded
- [ ] Part B: Safe Sender Folder selector shows provider default first, flat list, no sub-folders
- [ ] Part B: Deleted Rule Folder selector shows provider default first, flat list, no sub-folders
- [ ] Part B: Provider defaults configured per provider
- [ ] Path separator detected per-provider (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Works for Gmail IMAP, Gmail OAuth, AOL, Yahoo, and custom IMAP
- [ ] Existing folder selection behavior preserved for providers without sub-folders

### Rule Editing UI (F35)

**Status**: New (Sprint 20 testing feedback)
**Estimated Effort**: ~8-12h
**Phase**: Core Feature
**Platform**: All

**Overview**: Add the ability to edit existing rules from the Manage Rules screen. Since rules use regex patterns, the UI must help users who are not familiar with regex syntax.

**Key Features**:
1. **User-friendly input**: User enters a domain, email, or keyword in plain text, and the app generates the correct regex pattern
2. **Regex validation**: If the user edits the regex directly, validate it in real-time and show errors with suggested corrections
3. **Pattern preview**: Show what the pattern would match against sample text (reuse Rule Testing UI from Sprint 18)
4. **Edit dialog**: Tap a rule in Manage Rules > Edit button in details dialog
5. **Field editing**: Edit source_domain (regenerates regex), pattern_category, pattern_sub_type, enabled/disabled

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Edit button in rule details dialog opens edit screen
- [ ] Plain-text domain/email input generates correct regex pattern
- [ ] Direct regex editing with real-time validation
- [ ] Invalid regex shows error message with suggested fix
- [ ] Pattern preview shows match results against sample data
- [ ] Changes saved to database
- [ ] Rule name updated if source_domain changes

### F52: Multi-Variant Side-by-Side Install

**Status**: New (April 8, 2026)
**Estimated Effort**: ~16-24h (phased per platform)
**Phase**: Build and Release Infrastructure
**Platform**: All (Windows, Android, iOS)

**Overview**: Extend the existing dev/prod separation (ADR-0035, Windows only) to support all 9 build variants -- 3 channels (dev, production, store) across 3 platforms (Windows, Android, iOS) -- running simultaneously on the same machine/device without rebuilds.

**The 9 Variants**:

| Platform | Dev (feature/develop) | Production (main) | Store (downloaded) |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Windows | [OK] Built today | [OK] Built today | Microsoft Store install |
| Android | TBD | TBD | Google Play install |
| iOS | TBD | TBD | App Store install |

**Current State**:
- **Windows dev/prod**: ADR-0035 implemented in Sprint 19. Same .exe path, but different `secrets.*.json` builds use different data dirs (`MyEmailSpamFilter` vs `MyEmailSpamFilter_Dev`), task names, and mutexes. Whichever was built last is what runs.
- **Windows store**: MSIX submitted to Microsoft Store (Sprint 28). Installs to `Packages\{PackageFamilyName}\` -- separate from dev/prod data dirs.
- **Android**: Single applicationId (`com.example.my_email_spam_filter`). No flavors configured.
- **iOS**: Not yet built.

**Problem**: A user/developer needs to be able to run any combination of these 9 variants simultaneously to:
- Compare dev vs prod behavior on same data
- Test store version against local builds without uninstalling
- Reproduce store-only bugs while a fix is in dev
- Demonstrate prod features while continuing dev work

The Windows dev/prod current implementation requires a rebuild to switch -- only one is "current" at a time.

**Industry Best Practices**:

**Android (Build Flavors)** -- See [Android docs](https://developer.android.com/build/build-variants):
- Use `productFlavors` in `build.gradle.kts` with distinct `applicationIdSuffix` per flavor
- Example: `com.example.app` (store), `com.example.app.prod` (sideloaded prod), `com.example.app.dev` (dev)
- Each variant gets its own data directory, app icon, and Launcher entry
- Side-by-side install works automatically on the same device
- Use Manifest Placeholders for distinct app names (e.g., "SpamFilter", "SpamFilter PROD", "SpamFilter DEV")

**iOS (Bundle ID + Targets/Configurations)** -- See [Xcode multi-config](https://medium.com/@danielgalasko/run-multiple-versions-of-your-app-on-the-same-device-using-xcode-configurations-1fd3a220c608):
- iOS identifies apps by bundle identifier; cannot have two apps with the same ID
- Create distinct bundle IDs per variant: `com.example.spamfilter`, `com.example.spamfilter.prod`, `com.example.spamfilter.dev`
- Use Xcode build configurations or separate targets to switch bundle ID at build time
- Each variant becomes a distinct app on the device with its own data, icon, and TestFlight stream
- TestFlight typically uses a `.test` or `.beta` suffix to avoid colliding with App Store releases

**Windows (MSIX Package Family + Distinct .exe Names)**:
- MSIX uses `PackageFamilyName` for identity. Different `Identity Name` values produce distinct sandboxed installs.
- For non-MSIX (sideloaded) builds, distinct .exe filenames + distinct install directories enable coexistence
- Currently: `MyEmailSpamFilter.exe` is the same filename for dev and prod (only data dirs differ)
- Recommendation: build to environment-specific subdirs (`Release-dev/`, `Release-prod/`) and use environment-specific .exe names (`MyEmailSpamFilter.exe`, `MyEmailSpamFilter-Dev.exe`)

**Cross-Platform Pattern**:
1. **Single source tree, build-time variants**: Use Flutter's `--dart-define` + `flutter run --flavor` for entry points
2. **Distinct identifiers per variant**: applicationId/bundle ID/package family
3. **Distinct visual markers**: app name, icon overlay (e.g., yellow stripe for dev, red for staging)
4. **Distinct data isolation**: separate data dirs (already done for Windows; automatic for Android/iOS via OS)
5. **Build matrix in CI**: each push to `main` builds prod variants, each push to `develop` builds dev variants

**Key Decisions Needed (during sprint planning)**:
1. **Naming convention**: `SpamFilter` (store) / `SpamFilter Pro` (sideloaded prod) / `SpamFilter Dev` (dev)? Or use suffixes?
2. **Build artifact location**: Should dev and prod Windows builds output to separate dirs to enable coexistence without rebuild?
3. **Icon variants**: Acceptable to ship 3 icon designs (or icon overlays generated at build time)?
4. **Store identifier strategy**: Reserve all bundle IDs in advance (App Store Connect, Google Play Console, Microsoft Partner Center)?

**Implementation Phases**:

**Phase 1: Windows distinct .exe + distinct dirs (~4-6h)**
- Update `build-windows.ps1` to output to `build/windows/x64/runner/Release-{env}/`
- Rename .exe to `MyEmailSpamFilter.exe` (prod) and `MyEmailSpamFilter-Dev.exe` (dev) at build time
- Verify Microsoft Store MSIX is unaffected (it installs separately)
- Update launch scripts and docs to reference env-specific paths
- Test: prod and dev builds present simultaneously, both runnable

**Phase 2: Android flavors (~6-8h)**
- Configure `productFlavors` in `mobile-app/android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- Define `dev`, `prod`, `store` flavors with distinct `applicationIdSuffix`
- Add Manifest Placeholder for app name
- Generate distinct icons per flavor (or use icon overlay)
- Update build scripts (`build-with-secrets.ps1`) to take a flavor parameter
- Test: install all 3 variants on emulator side-by-side
- Note: Cannot fully test "store" flavor until app is in Google Play (use `prod` flavor as proxy with different applicationId)

**Phase 3: iOS bundle IDs (~6-10h, requires macOS)**
- Configure Xcode build configurations or targets for `dev`, `prod`, `store`
- Set distinct bundle IDs per configuration
- Configure provisioning profiles for each variant
- Update CI to build correct variant per branch
- Note: Requires Apple Developer Program account and reserved bundle IDs
- HOLD until iOS development begins

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Windows: dev, prod, and store builds all installable and runnable simultaneously
- [ ] Android: dev, prod, and store flavors all installable and runnable simultaneously on emulator
- [ ] iOS: dev, prod, and store configurations defined (full validation deferred to iOS dev)
- [ ] All 9 variants have distinct data directories (no cross-contamination)
- [ ] All 9 variants have visual markers (different name and/or icon)
- [ ] Build scripts updated to support variant selection
- [ ] Documentation updated: ADR (extend ADR-0035 or create new ADR), CLAUDE.md, build script READMEs
- [ ] No regression in existing dev/prod Windows separation
- [ ] CI builds correct variant per branch (main = prod+store, develop = dev)

**Dependencies**:
- iOS phase blocked until iOS development begins
- Android store flavor blocked until app is published to Google Play
- Windows store flavor already in place (MSIX from Sprint 28)

**Notes**:
- Phase 1 (Windows) is the only phase that can be done now without external dependencies
- Phases 2 and 3 should be combined with broader Android/iOS work
- Consider whether "store" flavor is really needed as a separate build, or if the actual store-downloaded app suffices

### F4: Background Scanning - Android

**Status**: HOLD (Android Google Play Store Readiness)
**Estimated Effort**: ~14-16h
**Phase**: Android Google Play Store Readiness
**Platform**: Android

**Overview**: Automatic periodic background scanning on Android with user-configured frequency using WorkManager.

**Key Features**:
- WorkManager for periodic background jobs
- Configurable scan frequency (hourly, daily, weekly)
- Battery-aware scheduling (defer when battery low)
- Notification on scan completion with results summary

**Dependencies**: Settings infrastructure (completed Sprint 12)

**Estimated Effort**: ~10-12h
**Phase**: Performance
**Platform**: All

**Overview**: Provider-specific optimizations leveraging unique API capabilities.

**Potential Features**:
- AOL: Bulk folder operations
- Gmail: Label-based filtering (faster than IMAP folder scans)
- Gmail: Batch email operations via API
- Outlook: Graph API integration (when implemented)

**Dependencies**: Core functionality complete

**Notes**: Defer until MVP complete. May not be needed if current performance acceptable.

### Body Rules Cleanup Script (F33)

**Status**: New (Sprint 21 testing feedback)
**Estimated Effort**: ~4-6h
**Phase**: Core App Quality
**Platform**: All

**Overview**: One-time Dart CLI script to clean up body rules. Many body rules are URL-targeting patterns that need better regex (similar to header Exact Domain / Entire Domain patterns but appropriate for URLs in email body content). Other body rules target non-URL body content and should not be affected.

**Issues to Address**:

1. **URL-targeting regex improvement**: Body rules that target URLs should use regex that specifically matches URLs, not arbitrary body text. Non-URL body rules (e.g., keyword matching) should remain unchanged.

2. **Duplicate consolidation**: Patterns like `.adamshetzner.com` and `adamshetzner.com` are duplicates and should be consolidated into a single rule.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Script identifies body rules that are URL-targeting vs non-URL patterns
- [ ] URL-targeting patterns converted to proper URL-matching regex
- [ ] Non-URL body rules left unchanged
- [ ] Duplicate patterns consolidated (e.g., `.domain.com` and `domain.com`)
- [ ] Backup DB before changes
- [ ] Report: patterns converted, duplicates removed, unchanged patterns
- [ ] All tests pass after cleanup

### F25: Rule Testing UI Enhancements

**Status**: Planned
**Estimated Effort**: ~6-8h
**Phase**: Core Feature
**Platform**: All

**Overview**: Enhance the Rule Testing screen (Settings > Tools > Test Rule Pattern) with additional capabilities to make it a more complete rule authoring tool.

**Enhancements**:
1. **Example Email Addresses**: Pre-populate the "Match against" list with email addresses from the Demo Scan data, giving users real addresses to test against without needing a live scan
2. **Plain Text to Regex Conversion**: When a user enters a plain text pattern (no regex metacharacters) and presses Enter/Test, automatically convert it to the equivalent regex pattern and display both
3. **Edit Rules with Test Tool**: Add a way to open an existing rule in the test tool from the Manage Rules screen, allowing users to modify and test patterns before saving

**Dependencies**: None (builds on existing Rule Testing UI from Sprint 18)

---

### F39: Scan Results Multi-Select and Bulk Rule Application

**Status**: HOLD (Post-MVP, Post-Windows Store)
**Estimated Effort**: ~12-16h
**Phase**: Post-MVP, Post-Windows Store
**Platform**: All (may need platform-specific UI patterns)

**Overview**: Allow users to select multiple emails in Scan Results (live and history) and apply a rule action to all selected items at once, rather than one at a time.

**Selection Mechanics**:
- Radial button (checkbox) to the left of each item for select/unselect
- Ctrl+click to add individual items to selection (Windows/desktop)
- Shift+click to select a range of items between two clicked items (Windows/desktop)
- Selection applies only to the currently filtered list (respects active filter chips)
- Touch-friendly selection for mobile (long-press to enter selection mode, tap to toggle)

**Bulk Actions (right-click context menu / action bar)**:
7 options:
1. Add Safe Sender - Exact Email
2. Add Safe Sender - Exact Domain
3. Add Safe Sender - Entire Domain
4. Add Block Rule - Exact Email
5. Add Block Rule - Exact Domain
6. Add Block Rule - Entire Domain
7. Remove Current Rule

**Platform-Specific UI Considerations**:
- **Windows Desktop**: Right-click context menu, Ctrl+click and Shift+click selection, radial buttons
- **Android/iOS**: Long-press to enter selection mode, floating action bar for bulk actions, tap to toggle selection
- **Display size**: Compact layouts may need bottom sheet instead of context menu
- UI investigation needed before implementation to determine best pattern per platform

**Dependencies**: Scan Results screen (completed Sprint 12), Rule management (completed Sprint 20)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] UI investigation completed: document recommended selection and action patterns per platform
- [ ] Multi-select works with Ctrl+click and Shift+click on desktop
- [ ] Radial button per item for direct select/unselect
- [ ] Selection scoped to current filter results only
- [ ] Right-click (desktop) or action bar (mobile) shows 7 bulk action options
- [ ] Bulk action applies chosen rule to all selected emails
- [ ] Works in both live scan results and scan history views
- [ ] Platform-appropriate UI for Windows, Android, and iOS

## Google Play Store Readiness (HOLD)

**Added**: February 15, 2026
**Status**: HOLD -- All GP items are on hold pending Product Owner prioritization
**Objective**: Features, configurations, and policy compliance needed to publish on the Google Play Store.

### Current App Assessment

The app is approximately 60-70% ready for Play Store publication. Core spam filtering functionality is complete and production-ready. The remaining work is primarily administrative (signing, permissions, policies, branding) and compliance-related (Gmail API verification, privacy policy, data safety declarations).
