# All Sprints Master Plan

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for all planned work -- features, bugs, spikes, and Google Play Store readiness items. Used alongside GitHub Issues for sprint planning and backlog management.

**Audience**: Claude Code models planning sprints; User prioritizing future work

**Last Updated**: April 19, 2026 (Sprint 35 retrospective + 0.5.2.0 store MSIX shipped; F81 added as Sprint 36 carry-in (Issue #242) -- store release process documentation; Sprint 36 will bump dev to 0.5.3.0)

## How to Maintain This Document

This section describes when and how to update this document during sprint execution. Referenced by SPRINT_EXECUTION_WORKFLOW.md (Phases 2.1, 3.2, 7.7), SPRINT_CHECKLIST.md, SPRINT_PLANNING.md, and SPRINT_RETROSPECTIVE.md.

### When to Update

| Sprint Phase | What to Update |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Phase 2 (Pre-Kickoff)** | Verify "Last Completed Sprint" is current; confirm all items from completed sprint are marked done or removed |
| **Phase 3 (Planning)** | Review "Next Sprint Candidates" for completeness; add any new items found in GitHub Issues; re-prioritize list; move selected items into sprint plan |
| **Phase 7 (Retrospective)** | Update "Past Sprint Summary" table; update "Last Completed Sprint"; remove completed feature/bug detail sections; add new issues discovered during sprint |
| **Backlog Refinement** | Full review of all sections; re-prioritize; add/remove items; verify GitHub Issue alignment |

### Maintenance Rules

1. **One list of incomplete work**: The "Next Sprint Candidates" section is THE single prioritized list. Do not create duplicate tracking elsewhere in this document.
2. **Remove completed work**: When a feature, bug, or spike is completed, remove its detail section from "Feature and Bug Details". History lives in sprint docs (`docs/sprints/`), CHANGELOG.md, and closed GitHub Issues.
3. **GitHub Issue alignment**: Every item in "Next Sprint Candidates" should reference a GitHub Issue number if one exists. Items without issues get issues created when added to a Sprint Plan.
4. **HOLD items last**: Items on HOLD are grouped at the bottom of the candidates list with a brief reason.
5. **Keep it current**: The "Last Updated" date at the top must reflect the most recent edit. Stale content erodes trust in the document.
6. **Minimal history**: Past Sprint Summary is a table of links. No completed feature details, no completed retrospective actions, no completed MVP feature lists.
7. **Detail sections are optional**: Not every candidate needs a detail section. Simple bugs or small features can be fully described in GitHub Issues alone. Only add detail sections for items that need architecture notes, task breakdowns, or context beyond what fits in a GitHub Issue.
8. **Cross-reference integrity**: When updating this document, verify that SPRINT_EXECUTION_WORKFLOW.md and SPRINT_CHECKLIST.md references remain accurate. Both reference this Maintenance Guide by name.

## Last Completed Sprint

**Sprint 35** (April 19, 2026)
- **Type**: Mixed (bug fix + testing execution + process improvement)
- **Feature**: 2 planned tasks (Issue #237) + retro-driven process improvements
- **Delivered**:
  - Bug fix (1): BUG-S34-1 (1-line stale `expect(resetResult.rules, 5)` fix in default_rule_set_service_test.dart line 422; restored develop test suite to 1363/0)
  - Testing execution (1): F69 (drove all 7 Sprint 34 WinWright scripts via MCP primitives against fresh Windows desktop dev build; 7 of 7 PASS; pivoted from JSON `run` schema to interactive MCP)
  - F56 script lifecycle update (in-sprint per §4a): both F56 scripts now do create -> verify -> delete -> verify-absent; test data retuned to non-colliding values (`.museum`, `winwright-e2e-test.invalid`)
  - WinWright run policy formalized: conditional per sprint + state-restoring (TESTING_STRATEGY.md mapping table)
  - Sprint 35 retrospective process improvements (P1, P2, P4, P5 applied; P3 backlogged): Phase Auto-Advance Rule (CLAUDE.md), Standing Approval Inventory (Phase 3.7), Model-Version Pitfalls appendix (CLAUDE.md), Sprint Resume Pattern memory; Category 2 testing-gap closure as Phase 5.1.1 step 2a sibling-grep
- **Backlog additions**: BUG-S35-1 (manual rule UI accepts duplicates -- Issue #239), F79 (full WinWright sweep -- HOLD, Issue #240), F80 (1-page Phase Cheat Sheet -- Issue #241, P3 deferred from retro)
- **Tests**: +0 net (1 line changed, no new tests; 1363 total passing, 0 analyzer issues)
- **Process improvement**: Codified the Opus 4.7 phase-boundary autonomy pattern that 4.6 had implicitly internalized; surfaced in retro after ~4h wall-clock cost across S34-S35
- **Store release**: Bumped dev version 0.5.1.0 -> 0.5.2.0 (prod was at 0.5.1.0 in store; 0.5.2.0 is the new submission target). Built signed MSIX at `mobile-app/build/windows/x64/runner/Release/my_email_spam_filter.msix` (17.4 MB). Harold to merge develop -> main and upload MSIX to Microsoft Store. Sprint 36 will bump dev to 0.5.3.0
- **Retrospective**: docs/sprints/SPRINT_35_RETROSPECTIVE.md
- **PR**: #238 (against develop)

## Next Sprint Candidates

**Last Reviewed**: April 16, 2026 (Sprint 33 completion -- removed F53, F54, F55, F65, F66, SEC-1b, SEC-8, SEC-14, SEC-19, SEC-22 and partial SEC-11)

All incomplete items in relative priority order. Priority in increments of 10; items that can sprint together in increments of 2. HOLD items grouped at bottom. See [Feature and Bug Details](#feature-and-bug-details) for deep-dive specs. See [BACKLOG_REFINEMENT.md](BACKLOG_REFINEMENT.md) for presentation format rules.

### Core App

**F52. Multi-variant side-by-side install across all stores (~16-24h) Priority 90**
- Phase: Build and Release Infrastructure
- Platform: All (Windows, Android, iOS)
- Extend ADR-0035 dev/prod separation to all 9 build variants (3 stores × 3 channels: dev, production, store)
- All variants must run simultaneously without rebuild on same machine/device
- [Detail](#f52-multi-variant-side-by-side-install)

**F63. Responsive design framework (~8-12h) Priority 70**
- Phase: UX Improvement
- Platform: All
- Implement adaptive breakpoints per ARSD AR-7: phone (<600dp), tablet (600-900dp), desktop (>900dp)
- LayoutBuilder + breakpoints approach (ARSD A6 recommendation)
- Priority screens: scan progress, results display, settings
- Related: F55 (navigation consistency) should be done before or with this
- Source: Sprint 30 gap analysis (SPRINT_30_GAP_ANALYSIS.md gap G23)

### Process

**F81. Store release process documentation (~5-6h) Priority 100 -- SPRINT 36 CARRY-IN (Issue #242)**
- Phase: Documentation / Release Engineering
- Platform: Windows (Microsoft Store)
- Mandatory Sprint 36 task -- not backlog. Carry-in from Sprint 35 retrospective Category 13 addendum (post-retro 2026-04-19); scope expanded 2026-04-20 after the prod-worktree rebuild surfaced 3 additional gaps (see Issue #242 comment).
- New `docs/STORE_RELEASE_PROCESS.md`: end-to-end walkthrough -- pre-release checklist, version bump (5-file checklist), supported rebuild instructions (`flutter pub run msix:create` + the mandatory `build_windows_args` config), MSIX verification, develop -> main merge process, Microsoft Partner Center upload + submit walkthrough, post-submission steps
- Deprecate or remove `mobile-app/scripts/build-msix.ps1` (had a PowerShell parser bug patched in Sprint 35; the Dart `msix` package path is the supported one and is what's wired in `pubspec.yaml`)
- Fix `mobile-app/.gitignore` line 120 (`*.manifest` blocks `runner.exe.manifest` which is required by Windows runner CMakeLists -- breaks fresh worktree builds with "No SOURCES given to target")
- Document `secrets.prod.json` recreation procedure (3 required keys: `WINDOWS_GMAIL_DESKTOP_CLIENT_ID`, `WINDOWS_GMAIL_DESKTOP_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI`); update `secrets.prod.json.template` to use the actual key names the code reads (template currently lists wrong key names)
- Document `build_windows_args` in `msix_config` as a hard requirement (without it, `msix:create` silently produces MSIX with empty OAuth credentials -- Gmail sign-in fails at runtime for every user)
- Update CLAUDE.md Common Commands and ADR-0035 cross-references
- Source: Sprint 35 store-prep + 2026-04-20 prod rebuild made all gaps visible

**F80. 1-page Phase Cheat Sheet for SPRINT_EXECUTION_WORKFLOW.md (~45min) Priority 80 (Issue #241)**
- Phase: Process / Documentation
- Platform: N/A (Claude Code workflow)
- Add a compact (~30-line) Phase Cheat Sheet at the top of SPRINT_EXECUTION_WORKFLOW.md (currently 1357 lines) so models can identify current phase + next action without reading the full doc
- Format: 7-row table (Phase | Purpose | Top-3 Actions | Auto-advance trigger) with anchor links to detailed sections
- Source: Sprint 35 retrospective Process Issues -- proposal P3 (Opus 4.7 phase-boundary overhead)
- Companion to Sprint 35 fixes already shipped: Phase Auto-Advance Rule (CLAUDE.md), Standing Approval Inventory (Phase 3.7), Model-Version Pitfalls appendix (CLAUDE.md)

### Bugs

**BUG-S35-1. Manual rule creation allows duplicate TLD entries (~2-3h) Priority 70 (Issue #239)**
- Phase: Bug fix
- Platform: All (rule logic), Windows (where discovered)
- File: `mobile-app/lib/core/services/manual_rule_creator.dart` (or equivalent), plus widget validation in `ManualRuleCreateScreen`
- Failure: Saving a TLD block rule for a TLD already in the bundled rules table (e.g., `.xyz`) silently inserts a duplicate row. Two rules with identical pattern and identical sub-type both run on every scan.
- Fix: Add a uniqueness check on save -- compare normalized pattern + condition_type + sub_type against existing rules table; reject with validation error if match found. Same logic for safe senders.
- Discovery: Sprint 35 F69 execution; required direct SQLite cleanup because UI delete path was non-deterministic when two rules shared the same visible label.
- Source: Sprint 35 F69 manual testing (`docs/sprints/SPRINT_35_PLAN.md` Manual Testing Notes)

### Security Hardening (Sprint 31 Audit)

**SEC-4. Android: Create network_security_config.xml (~1h) Priority 40 -- HIGH**
- Phase: Security
- Platform: Android
- Block cleartext traffic, pin domains for OAuth and IMAP
- Reference in AndroidManifest.xml
- Source: Sprint 31 security audit (S11)


**SEC-6. Android: Configure release signing (~2h) Priority 40 -- HIGH**
- Phase: Security
- Platform: Android
- Create release keystore, configure in build.gradle.kts
- Overlaps with GP-2 (release signing)
- Source: Sprint 31 security audit (S12)

**SEC-7. Android: Enable R8 obfuscation + Dart obfuscation (~2h) Priority 40 -- HIGH**
- Phase: Security
- Platform: Android
- Enable minifyEnabled, create proguard-rules.pro
- Use --obfuscate --split-debug-info for Dart
- Overlaps with GP-9 (ProGuard/R8)
- Source: Sprint 31 security audit (S13)

**SEC-8b. Certificate pinning for IMAP endpoints (~4-6h) Priority 42 -- HIGH**
- Phase: Security
- Platform: All
- OAuth HTTPS pinning shipped Sprint 33 (CertificatePinner + PinnedHttpClient for accounts.google.com, oauth2.googleapis.com, gmail.googleapis.com, www.googleapis.com)
- Gap: `enough_mail.ImapClient.connectToServer` does not expose a `SecurityContext` or bad-cert callback, so IMAP pinning (imap.gmail.com, imap.aol.com, etc.) was deferred
- Options: (1) fork `enough_mail` to expose the callback; (2) wrap the socket manually via `SecureSocket.connect` with a custom `SecurityContext` before handing it to the IMAP client; (3) file upstream issue on `enough_mail`
- Source: Sprint 33 SEC-8 implementation notes (CertificatePinner dartdoc)

**SEC-9. Move hardcoded Android client ID to build-time injection (~1h) Priority 42 -- HIGH**
- Phase: Security
- Platform: Android
- Move _androidClientId to --dart-define or google-services.json
- Source: Sprint 31 security audit (S5)

**SEC-11b. SQLCipher driver swap + plaintext-to-encrypted migration (~6-10h) Priority 60 -- MEDIUM**
- Phase: Security
- Platform: All
- Sprint 33 shipped the infrastructure: DatabaseEncryptionKeyService (256-bit key in flutter_secure_storage), opt-in `encrypt_database` settings toggle (default off)
- Gap: DatabaseHelper still uses the plaintext sqflite driver. Flipping requires:
  - Add deps: `sqflite_sqlcipher` + `sqlcipher_flutter_libs`
  - Platform plugin registration for Windows + Android
  - Atomic plaintext-to-encrypted migration on first opt-in (backup, re-open with key, copy, swap, verify, delete backup)
  - QA on real installs (Windows desktop + Android emulator + physical device)
  - Flip `encrypt_database` default to true after QA
- Source: Sprint 33 SEC-11 scoping decision (partial completion)

**SEC-15. IMAP host validation for custom servers (~1h) Priority 62 -- MEDIUM**
- Phase: Security
- Platform: All
- Reject internal/private IP ranges when custom IMAP is implemented
- Dependency: F37 (folder selectors / custom IMAP)
- Source: Sprint 31 security audit (S19)

**F6. Provider-Specific Optimizations (~10-12h) Priority 100**
- Phase: Performance
- Platform: All
- [Detail](#f6-provider-specific-optimizations)

**F61. Architecture documentation refresh (~3-4h) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: Documentation
- Platform: All
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md: remove Dual-Write pattern (superseded Sprint 20), add missing services (DefaultRuleSetService, RuleConflictDetector, EmailAvailabilityChecker, EmailBodyParser, DevEnvironmentSeeder), add missing screens (yaml_import_export, rule_test), add missing DB tables (unmatched_emails, background_scan_log)
- Update ARSD.md: remove Dual-Write from design patterns table, update Store certification status to "Passed", update Glossary
- HOLD rationale: Moved to HOLD during Sprint 33 planning (April 14, 2026) per user direction. Sprint 33 includes ARCHITECTURE.md updates for new components (SQLCipher, HelpScreen, DataDeletionService, PatternCompiler revisions) so partial doc refresh happens organically. Full F61 work can be reactivated when next periodic architecture review is scheduled.
- Source: Sprint 30 gap analysis (SPRINT_30_GAP_ANALYSIS.md gaps G1-G6, G16-G22)

**F64. CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (~4-6h) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: DevOps
- Platform: All
- GitHub Actions workflow for: flutter analyze, flutter test, build verification
- Trigger on PR to develop
- HOLD rationale: Current CI/CD equivalent is handled by Claude Code sprint execution workflow (flutter analyze, flutter test, Windows build in Phase 5). Could be implemented later if beneficial to dev team, maintenance team, or instructed by Product Owner.
- Source: Sprint 30 gap analysis (SPRINT_30_GAP_ANALYSIS.md gap G24)

### HOLD Items (Periodic Reviews)

**F70. Periodic Security Deep Dive (~4-8h per review) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: Security Spike (reusable template)
- Platform: All
- **Generic scope**: Security review based on Application Development Best Practices and OWASP Mobile Top 10 (use current year edition)
- **Application-specific scope**:
  - Dependency CVEs (flutter pub outdated, known vulnerability databases)
  - SQL injection and parameterization audit
  - Regex injection and ReDoS pattern review
  - Credential storage and logging audit
  - Platform-specific security: Windows 11 Store (MSIX sandbox, AppContainer), Android (APK/AAB signing, manifest permissions, ProGuard), iOS (App Transport Security, keychain, sandbox), Linux (file permissions, desktop integration)
  - App store compliance: Microsoft Store certification requirements, Google Play data safety policies, Apple App Store review guidelines
  - Device-specific concerns: biometric auth, secure enclave, clipboard access, screenshot protection
- **How to use**: Duplicate this item, assign a sprint, and remove HOLD. After completion, keep this template for next review.
- HOLD rationale: Template item. Duplicate when periodic security review is needed.
- Source: Sprint 31 retrospective feedback

**F71. Periodic Architecture Deep Dive (~4-8h per review) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: Architecture Spike (reusable template)
- Platform: All
- **Generic scope**: Architecture review based on Application Development Best Practices
- **Application-specific scope**:
  - ADR drift detection: compare all ADRs against current codebase implementation
  - ARCHITECTURE.md alignment: verify documented components, services, and patterns match code
  - ARSD.md alignment: verify architectural requirements and standards document is current
  - Platform-specific architecture: Windows 11 Store (MSIX packaging, single-instance mutex, app data paths), Android (activity lifecycle, WorkManager, flavors), iOS (SwiftUI/UIKit bridge, entitlements, provisioning), Linux (GTK integration, libsecret, packaging)
  - App store constraints: store-specific sandboxing, capability declarations, update mechanisms
  - Device constraints: screen size breakpoints, input methods (touch, mouse, keyboard), offline capability
  - Dead code and deprecated class detection
  - Test coverage gaps relative to architecture
- **How to use**: Duplicate this item, assign a sprint, and remove HOLD. After completion, keep this template for next review.
- HOLD rationale: Template item. Duplicate when periodic architecture review is needed.
- Source: Sprint 31 retrospective feedback (based on Sprint 30 architecture deep dive experience)

### HOLD Items (Post-Windows Store)

**F33. Body rules cleanup script (~4-6h) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: Core App Quality
- Platform: All
- Post-Windows Store release
- [Detail](#body-rules-cleanup-script)

- Phase: Core Feature
- Platform: All
- Post-Windows Store release
- [Detail](#f25-rule-testing-ui-enhancements)

**F35. Rule editing UI with regex generation (~8-12h) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: Core Feature
- Platform: All
- Post-Windows Store release
- [Detail](#rule-editing-ui)

**F37. Folder selectors: two-level listing (~6-8h) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: Core Feature
- Platform: All
- Post-Windows Store release
- [Detail](#folder-selectors-two-level-listing)

**F74. FAQ section in Help (~2-4h) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: Documentation / UX
- Platform: All
- Post-Windows Store release
- [Detail](#f74-faq-section-in-help)

**F75. Help walkthrough: end-to-end first-use guide (~4-6h) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: Documentation / UX
- Platform: All
- Post-Windows Store release
- [Detail](#f75-help-walkthrough-end-to-end-first-use-guide)

**F76. Visual regression testing for WinWright (~6-10h) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: Testing infrastructure
- Platform: Windows desktop (initially)
- From Sprint 34 retro Category 14: WinWright tests verify presence/clickability via accessibility tree but cannot detect alignment, centering, or visual layout issues. Add screenshot diffing or layout-bounds-check assertions to F69 test suite.

**F77. Hookify rule: block "want me to proceed?" patterns (~1h) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: Process automation
- Platform: N/A (Claude Code harness)
- From Sprint 34 retro Category 14: Sprint plan approval covers all tasks; Claude paused twice for "should I continue?" mid-sprint. Hookify rule should reject phrases like "want me to proceed?", "should I continue?", "ready to proceed with X?" with the sprint-plan-approval reminder.

**F78. Widget tests for ManualRuleCreateScreen rendering (~3-4h) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: Testing
- Platform: All
- From Sprint 34 retro Category 14: Only logic-level tests for F56 exist. Add widget tests covering radio button selection, input field validation feedback, pattern preview rendering, and confirmation dialog.

**F79. Full WinWright E2E test sweep (run entire suite end-to-end) (~4-8h) Priority HOLD (Issue #240)**
- Phase: Testing / Quality
- Platform: Windows
- Run the *entire* WinWright suite (currently 7 scripts) end-to-end against a fresh Windows desktop dev build, with strict pre/post snapshot of DB state to verify zero test artifacts left behind
- Distinct from per-sprint conditional WinWright runs (which only execute scripts whose tested surface was touched by sprint changes)
- Triggers: major release prep, large UI refactor (>10 files in `lib/ui/`), accessibility-tree change, or Product Owner request
- HOLD rationale: On-demand only; not a recurring sprint item. Activate when a trigger condition is met.

### HOLD Items (Android / Google Play Store)

**Issue #163. Android app not tested in several sprints (~2-4h) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: Android Google Play Store Readiness
- Platform: Android
- Validation sprint needed to verify Android app still works
- Expanded scope (Sprint 30 review): ADR-0028 permission validation (POST_NOTIFICATIONS not needed initially, add when background scanning implemented)
- Expanded scope (Sprint 30 review): Include unique UI tests via Playwright/WinWright as needed/appropriate

**F4. Background Scanning - Android (~14-16h) Priority HOLD**
- Phase: Android Google Play Store Readiness
- Platform: Android
- [Detail](#f4-background-scanning-android)

## Feature and Bug Details

This section contains detailed specifications for incomplete items only. Completed features have their details in sprint documents and CHANGELOG.md.

### Folder Selectors: Two-Level Listing (F37)

**Status**: New (Sprint 20 testing feedback)
**Estimated Effort**: ~6-8h
**Phase**: Core Feature
**Platform**: All

**Overview**: Update folder selector UI (used by Safe Sender Folder, Deleted Rule Folder, and Default Folders settings) with context-aware behavior: two-level collapsible folders for Default Folders, and flat lists with provider defaults first for Safe Sender and Deleted Rule folder selectors.

**Part A: Default Folders selector (multi-select for scan)**

Two-level collapsible folder tree:

```
INBOX
Bulk Mail
Bulk Email
[Gmail] >              (expandable group, collapsed by default)
    [Gmail]/Trash
    [Gmail]/Spam
    [Gmail]/Sent Mail
    [Gmail]/Drafts
    [Gmail]/All Mail
Notes >                (expandable group)
    Notes/Work
    Notes/Personal
```

- Top-level folders shown flat (INBOX, Bulk Mail, etc.)
- Folders with children shown as expandable groups (chevron icon)
- Only first level of children shown (not grandchildren)
- Collapsed by default -- user expands to see children
- Junk/Trash folders auto-highlighted regardless of nesting depth
- Non-selectable parent containers (e.g., `[Gmail]`) shown as group headers only

**Part B: Safe Sender Folder and Deleted Rule Folder selectors (single-select)**

Flat list with provider default first:

- **Safe Sender Folder**: Provider default safe sender folder listed first (e.g., INBOX), remaining folders alphabetical, no sub-folders
- **Deleted Rule Folder**: Provider default deleted folder listed first (e.g., Trash or [Gmail]/Trash), remaining folders alphabetical, no sub-folders

Provider defaults:
- AOL: Deleted Rule = Trash, Safe Sender = INBOX
- Gmail IMAP: Deleted Rule = [Gmail]/Trash, Safe Sender = INBOX
- Gmail OAuth: Deleted Rule = TRASH, Safe Sender = INBOX
- Yahoo: Deleted Rule = Trash, Safe Sender = INBOX

**Provider-Specific Folder Hierarchies** (research before implementation):
- **Gmail IMAP**: `[Gmail]/` prefix for system folders. Custom labels may also use `/` hierarchy. Separator: `/`
- **AOL**: Flat folder structure (INBOX, Bulk Mail, Bulk Email, Sent, Trash). No sub-folders typically. Separator: `/`
- **Yahoo**: Flat structure similar to AOL (Inbox, Bulk, Sent, Trash, Draft). Separator: `/`
- **iCloud**: May have nested folders. Separator: `/`
- **Custom IMAP**: Unknown hierarchy -- must handle any structure. Separator: varies (usually `/` or `.`)

**Implementation Note**: The path separator varies by provider and is returned by the IMAP server in `listMailboxes()` response. Use `mailbox.pathSeparator` to split paths into parent/child, do not hardcode `/`.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Research and document actual folder hierarchy for each supported provider before implementation
- [ ] Part A: FolderSelectionScreen groups child folders under their parent (Default Folders only)
- [ ] Part A: Parent folders with children show expand/collapse toggle
- [ ] Part A: Groups collapsed by default, only first-level children shown
- [ ] Part A: Non-selectable parent containers cannot be selected, only expanded
- [ ] Part B: Safe Sender Folder selector shows provider default first, flat list, no sub-folders
- [ ] Part B: Deleted Rule Folder selector shows provider default first, flat list, no sub-folders
- [ ] Part B: Provider defaults configured per provider
- [ ] Path separator detected per-provider (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Works for Gmail IMAP, Gmail OAuth, AOL, Yahoo, and custom IMAP
- [ ] Existing folder selection behavior preserved for providers without sub-folders

### Rule Editing UI (F35)

**Status**: New (Sprint 20 testing feedback)
**Estimated Effort**: ~8-12h
**Phase**: Core Feature
**Platform**: All

**Overview**: Add the ability to edit existing rules from the Manage Rules screen. Since rules use regex patterns, the UI must help users who are not familiar with regex syntax.

**Key Features**:
1. **User-friendly input**: User enters a domain, email, or keyword in plain text, and the app generates the correct regex pattern
2. **Regex validation**: If the user edits the regex directly, validate it in real-time and show errors with suggested corrections
3. **Pattern preview**: Show what the pattern would match against sample text (reuse Rule Testing UI from Sprint 18)
4. **Edit dialog**: Tap a rule in Manage Rules > Edit button in details dialog
5. **Field editing**: Edit source_domain (regenerates regex), pattern_category, pattern_sub_type, enabled/disabled

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Edit button in rule details dialog opens edit screen
- [ ] Plain-text domain/email input generates correct regex pattern
- [ ] Direct regex editing with real-time validation
- [ ] Invalid regex shows error message with suggested fix
- [ ] Pattern preview shows match results against sample data
- [ ] Changes saved to database
- [ ] Rule name updated if source_domain changes

### F52: Multi-Variant Side-by-Side Install

**Status**: New (April 8, 2026)
**Estimated Effort**: ~16-24h (phased per platform)
**Phase**: Build and Release Infrastructure
**Platform**: All (Windows, Android, iOS)

**Overview**: Extend the existing dev/prod separation (ADR-0035, Windows only) to support all 9 build variants -- 3 channels (dev, production, store) across 3 platforms (Windows, Android, iOS) -- running simultaneously on the same machine/device without rebuilds.

**The 9 Variants**:

| Platform | Dev (feature/develop) | Production (main) | Store (downloaded) |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Windows | [OK] Built today | [OK] Built today | Microsoft Store install |
| Android | TBD | TBD | Google Play install |
| iOS | TBD | TBD | App Store install |

**Current State**:
- **Windows dev/prod**: ADR-0035 implemented in Sprint 19. Same .exe path, but different `secrets.*.json` builds use different data dirs (`MyEmailSpamFilter` vs `MyEmailSpamFilter_Dev`), task names, and mutexes. Whichever was built last is what runs.
- **Windows store**: MSIX submitted to Microsoft Store (Sprint 28). Installs to `Packages\{PackageFamilyName}\` -- separate from dev/prod data dirs.
- **Android**: Single applicationId (`com.example.my_email_spam_filter`). No flavors configured.
- **iOS**: Not yet built.

**Problem**: A user/developer needs to be able to run any combination of these 9 variants simultaneously to:
- Compare dev vs prod behavior on same data
- Test store version against local builds without uninstalling
- Reproduce store-only bugs while a fix is in dev
- Demonstrate prod features while continuing dev work

The Windows dev/prod current implementation requires a rebuild to switch -- only one is "current" at a time.

**Industry Best Practices**:

**Android (Build Flavors)** -- See [Android docs](https://developer.android.com/build/build-variants):
- Use `productFlavors` in `build.gradle.kts` with distinct `applicationIdSuffix` per flavor
- Example: `com.example.app` (store), `com.example.app.prod` (sideloaded prod), `com.example.app.dev` (dev)
- Each variant gets its own data directory, app icon, and Launcher entry
- Side-by-side install works automatically on the same device
- Use Manifest Placeholders for distinct app names (e.g., "SpamFilter", "SpamFilter PROD", "SpamFilter DEV")

**iOS (Bundle ID + Targets/Configurations)** -- See [Xcode multi-config](https://medium.com/@danielgalasko/run-multiple-versions-of-your-app-on-the-same-device-using-xcode-configurations-1fd3a220c608):
- iOS identifies apps by bundle identifier; cannot have two apps with the same ID
- Create distinct bundle IDs per variant: `com.example.spamfilter`, `com.example.spamfilter.prod`, `com.example.spamfilter.dev`
- Use Xcode build configurations or separate targets to switch bundle ID at build time
- Each variant becomes a distinct app on the device with its own data, icon, and TestFlight stream
- TestFlight typically uses a `.test` or `.beta` suffix to avoid colliding with App Store releases

**Windows (MSIX Package Family + Distinct .exe Names)**:
- MSIX uses `PackageFamilyName` for identity. Different `Identity Name` values produce distinct sandboxed installs.
- For non-MSIX (sideloaded) builds, distinct .exe filenames + distinct install directories enable coexistence
- Currently: `MyEmailSpamFilter.exe` is the same filename for dev and prod (only data dirs differ)
- Recommendation: build to environment-specific subdirs (`Release-dev/`, `Release-prod/`) and use environment-specific .exe names (`MyEmailSpamFilter.exe`, `MyEmailSpamFilter-Dev.exe`)

**Cross-Platform Pattern**:
1. **Single source tree, build-time variants**: Use Flutter's `--dart-define` + `flutter run --flavor` for entry points
2. **Distinct identifiers per variant**: applicationId/bundle ID/package family
3. **Distinct visual markers**: app name, icon overlay (e.g., yellow stripe for dev, red for staging)
4. **Distinct data isolation**: separate data dirs (already done for Windows; automatic for Android/iOS via OS)
5. **Build matrix in CI**: each push to `main` builds prod variants, each push to `develop` builds dev variants

**Key Decisions Needed (during sprint planning)**:
1. **Naming convention**: `SpamFilter` (store) / `SpamFilter Pro` (sideloaded prod) / `SpamFilter Dev` (dev)? Or use suffixes?
2. **Build artifact location**: Should dev and prod Windows builds output to separate dirs to enable coexistence without rebuild?
3. **Icon variants**: Acceptable to ship 3 icon designs (or icon overlays generated at build time)?
4. **Store identifier strategy**: Reserve all bundle IDs in advance (App Store Connect, Google Play Console, Microsoft Partner Center)?

**Implementation Phases**:

**Phase 1: Windows distinct .exe + distinct dirs (~4-6h)**
- Update `build-windows.ps1` to output to `build/windows/x64/runner/Release-{env}/`
- Rename .exe to `MyEmailSpamFilter.exe` (prod) and `MyEmailSpamFilter-Dev.exe` (dev) at build time
- Verify Microsoft Store MSIX is unaffected (it installs separately)
- Update launch scripts and docs to reference env-specific paths
- Test: prod and dev builds present simultaneously, both runnable

**Phase 2: Android flavors (~6-8h)**
- Configure `productFlavors` in `mobile-app/android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- Define `dev`, `prod`, `store` flavors with distinct `applicationIdSuffix`
- Add Manifest Placeholder for app name
- Generate distinct icons per flavor (or use icon overlay)
- Update build scripts (`build-with-secrets.ps1`) to take a flavor parameter
- Test: install all 3 variants on emulator side-by-side
- Note: Cannot fully test "store" flavor until app is in Google Play (use `prod` flavor as proxy with different applicationId)

**Phase 3: iOS bundle IDs (~6-10h, requires macOS)**
- Configure Xcode build configurations or targets for `dev`, `prod`, `store`
- Set distinct bundle IDs per configuration
- Configure provisioning profiles for each variant
- Update CI to build correct variant per branch
- Note: Requires Apple Developer Program account and reserved bundle IDs
- HOLD until iOS development begins

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Windows: dev, prod, and store builds all installable and runnable simultaneously
- [ ] Android: dev, prod, and store flavors all installable and runnable simultaneously on emulator
- [ ] iOS: dev, prod, and store configurations defined (full validation deferred to iOS dev)
- [ ] All 9 variants have distinct data directories (no cross-contamination)
- [ ] All 9 variants have visual markers (different name and/or icon)
- [ ] Build scripts updated to support variant selection
- [ ] Documentation updated: ADR (extend ADR-0035 or create new ADR), CLAUDE.md, build script READMEs
- [ ] No regression in existing dev/prod Windows separation
- [ ] CI builds correct variant per branch (main = prod+store, develop = dev)

**Dependencies**:
- iOS phase blocked until iOS development begins
- Android store flavor blocked until app is published to Google Play
- Windows store flavor already in place (MSIX from Sprint 28)

**Notes**:
- Phase 1 (Windows) is the only phase that can be done now without external dependencies
- Phases 2 and 3 should be combined with broader Android/iOS work
- Consider whether "store" flavor is really needed as a separate build, or if the actual store-downloaded app suffices

---

### F4: Background Scanning - Android

**Status**: HOLD (Android Google Play Store Readiness)
**Estimated Effort**: ~14-16h
**Phase**: Android Google Play Store Readiness
**Platform**: Android

**Overview**: Automatic periodic background scanning on Android with user-configured frequency using WorkManager.

**Key Features**:
- WorkManager for periodic background jobs
- Configurable scan frequency (hourly, daily, weekly)
- Battery-aware scheduling (defer when battery low)
- Notification on scan completion with results summary

**Dependencies**: Settings infrastructure (completed Sprint 12)

---

### F6: Provider-Specific Optimizations

**Status**: Idea
**Estimated Effort**: ~10-12h
**Phase**: Performance
**Platform**: All

**Overview**: Provider-specific optimizations leveraging unique API capabilities.

**Potential Features**:
- AOL: Bulk folder operations
- Gmail: Label-based filtering (faster than IMAP folder scans)
- Gmail: Batch email operations via API
- Outlook: Graph API integration (when implemented)

**Dependencies**: Core functionality complete

**Notes**: Defer until MVP complete. May not be needed if current performance acceptable.

---

### Body Rules Cleanup Script (F33)

**Status**: New (Sprint 21 testing feedback)
**Estimated Effort**: ~4-6h
**Phase**: Core App Quality
**Platform**: All

**Overview**: One-time Dart CLI script to clean up body rules. Many body rules are URL-targeting patterns that need better regex (similar to header Exact Domain / Entire Domain patterns but appropriate for URLs in email body content). Other body rules target non-URL body content and should not be affected.

**Issues to Address**:

1. **URL-targeting regex improvement**: Body rules that target URLs should use regex that specifically matches URLs, not arbitrary body text. Non-URL body rules (e.g., keyword matching) should remain unchanged.

2. **Duplicate consolidation**: Patterns like `.adamshetzner.com` and `adamshetzner.com` are duplicates and should be consolidated into a single rule.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Script identifies body rules that are URL-targeting vs non-URL patterns
- [ ] URL-targeting patterns converted to proper URL-matching regex
- [ ] Non-URL body rules left unchanged
- [ ] Duplicate patterns consolidated (e.g., `.domain.com` and `domain.com`)
- [ ] Backup DB before changes
- [ ] Report: patterns converted, duplicates removed, unchanged patterns
- [ ] All tests pass after cleanup

---

### F25: Rule Testing UI Enhancements

**Status**: Planned
**Estimated Effort**: ~6-8h
**Phase**: Core Feature
**Platform**: All

**Overview**: Enhance the Rule Testing screen (Settings > Tools > Test Rule Pattern) with additional capabilities to make it a more complete rule authoring tool.

**Enhancements**:
1. **Example Email Addresses**: Pre-populate the "Match against" list with email addresses from the Demo Scan data, giving users real addresses to test against without needing a live scan
2. **Plain Text to Regex Conversion**: When a user enters a plain text pattern (no regex metacharacters) and presses Enter/Test, automatically convert it to the equivalent regex pattern and display both
3. **Edit Rules with Test Tool**: Add a way to open an existing rule in the test tool from the Manage Rules screen, allowing users to modify and test patterns before saving

**Dependencies**: None (builds on existing Rule Testing UI from Sprint 18)

---

### F39: Scan Results Multi-Select and Bulk Rule Application

**Status**: HOLD (Post-MVP, Post-Windows Store)
**Estimated Effort**: ~12-16h
**Phase**: Post-MVP, Post-Windows Store
**Platform**: All (may need platform-specific UI patterns)

**Overview**: Allow users to select multiple emails in Scan Results (live and history) and apply a rule action to all selected items at once, rather than one at a time.

**Selection Mechanics**:
- Radial button (checkbox) to the left of each item for select/unselect
- Ctrl+click to add individual items to selection (Windows/desktop)
- Shift+click to select a range of items between two clicked items (Windows/desktop)
- Selection applies only to the currently filtered list (respects active filter chips)
- Touch-friendly selection for mobile (long-press to enter selection mode, tap to toggle)

**Bulk Actions (right-click context menu / action bar)**:
7 options:
1. Add Safe Sender - Exact Email
2. Add Safe Sender - Exact Domain
3. Add Safe Sender - Entire Domain
4. Add Block Rule - Exact Email
5. Add Block Rule - Exact Domain
6. Add Block Rule - Entire Domain
7. Remove Current Rule

**Platform-Specific UI Considerations**:
- **Windows Desktop**: Right-click context menu, Ctrl+click and Shift+click selection, radial buttons
- **Android/iOS**: Long-press to enter selection mode, floating action bar for bulk actions, tap to toggle selection
- **Display size**: Compact layouts may need bottom sheet instead of context menu
- UI investigation needed before implementation to determine best pattern per platform

**Dependencies**: Scan Results screen (completed Sprint 12), Rule management (completed Sprint 20)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] UI investigation completed: document recommended selection and action patterns per platform
- [ ] Multi-select works with Ctrl+click and Shift+click on desktop
- [ ] Radial button per item for direct select/unselect
- [ ] Selection scoped to current filter results only
- [ ] Right-click (desktop) or action bar (mobile) shows 7 bulk action options
- [ ] Bulk action applies chosen rule to all selected emails
- [ ] Works in both live scan results and scan history views
- [ ] Platform-appropriate UI for Windows, Android, and iOS

### F74: FAQ Section in Help

**Status**: HOLD (Post-Windows Store)
**Estimated Effort**: ~2-4h
**Phase**: Documentation / UX
**Platform**: All
**Added**: April 18, 2026 (Sprint 34 testing feedback)

**Overview**: Add a Frequently Asked Questions section to the in-app Help screen (F54 from Sprint 33 added the Help infrastructure). Users have asked about technical concepts during F56 testing that warrant FAQ-style answers rather than burying them in walkthrough text.

**Required FAQ topics**:
- **What is a TLD (Top-Level Domain)?** -- explain TLD concept (.com, .uk, .xyz), how the app's TLD block rules work, why blocking a TLD is heavy-handed (blocks everything from that TLD), and when to use entire-domain rules instead.
- **What is the IANA TLD list and why does the app use it?** -- explain IANA's role as the authority for valid TLDs, why the app rejects fake TLDs (`.com444`, `.whatevericanthinkof`), how the list is updated (`scripts/update_iana_tlds.sh`), and what to do if a real new TLD is rejected (file an issue).
- **What is the difference between Entire Domain, Exact Domain, Exact Email, and Top-Level Domain?** -- with concrete examples and matched/unmatched email lists for each.
- **What is a Safe Sender?** -- explain whitelist precedence over block rules.
- **Why does the scanner skip some emails?** -- explain Read-Only mode, default folders setting, retention.
- **What does "ReDoS" mean and why was my pattern rejected?** -- explain catastrophic backtracking in plain language with the rejected pattern shown.
- **Where is my data stored?** -- per ADR-0030 (privacy/zero telemetry), point to `MyEmailSpamFilter` AppData directory.
- **How do I export and re-import my rules?** -- point to Settings > Data Management.

**Implementation**:
- New `HelpSection.faq` enum value
- New `_buildFaqSection()` method in `help_screen.dart`
- ExpansionTile per question for collapsible Q&A
- Add `Help` icon entry on the Help screen jumping to FAQ
- Cross-reference from manual rule creation screen ("Learn more about TLDs" link)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] FAQ section accessible from Help screen
- [ ] At least 8 questions answered (the topics above)
- [ ] Each answer fits on one screen (no scrolling within an answer)
- [ ] TLD/IANA answers explain the F56 validation behavior users encountered
- [ ] Cross-references from rule creation screens to relevant FAQ entries

### F75: Help Walkthrough -- End-to-End First-Use Guide

**Status**: HOLD (Post-Windows Store)
**Estimated Effort**: ~4-6h
**Phase**: Documentation / UX
**Platform**: All
**Added**: April 18, 2026 (Sprint 34 testing feedback)

**Overview**: Add a step-by-step walkthrough to the in-app Help screen that guides a first-time user through the recommended workflow from install to confident production use. Builds on the F54 Help infrastructure (Sprint 33).

**Walkthrough steps to document**:

1. **Install + first launch** -- account setup, choose provider, OAuth or app-password flow, first-run rule seeding (1638 default block rules from F73).

2. **Run a Demo scan first** -- explain the Demo Mode (ADR-0020) with synthetic emails. Lets users see how rule matching, results display, and the Process Results flow work without touching real email.

3. **Read-only manual scan with "move matched" target folder**:
   - Set Manual Scan to **Read-Only Mode** (Settings > Scan)
   - Set the **Default Folders > Spam folder** target to a safe destination (e.g., a user-created `Review-Spam` folder) so matched emails get **moved** rather than deleted
   - Run a manual scan
   - Walk through Results: which emails matched which rules
   - **For false positives** (legitimate emails matched as spam): use F56 to add a Safe Sender (recommend Entire Domain as the general best path; recommend Exact Email for transactional senders like banks/airlines/utilities where only one specific address is trusted)
   - **For real spam** that matched correctly: confirm the rule, no action needed
   - **For real spam not matched**: use F56 Add Block Rule -- recommend Entire Domain as default best practice; recommend Exact Email only for one-off senders that share a domain with legitimate mail (e.g., a single bad sender at gmail.com)

4. **Switch to "move all" mode and re-scan**:
   - After tuning rules and safe senders, change Manual Scan back to delete/move based on rule actions (not Read-Only)
   - Run another manual scan
   - Verify behavior matches expectations from the dry-run pass
   - If unexpected results: revert via Scan History -> per-email undo (where supported), then refine rules

**Implementation**:
- New `HelpSection.walkthrough` enum value
- Numbered step list with screenshots (or text-only initially) per step
- Each step links to the relevant in-app screen (e.g., "Open Settings > Scan" deep-link)
- Add a "First time? Start here" callout on the main Help screen entry pointing to the walkthrough
- Could be presented as a one-time onboarding overlay on first launch (out of scope for v1; flag for future consideration)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Walkthrough section accessible from Help screen
- [ ] All 4 numbered steps documented with concrete UI references
- [ ] Recommendation hierarchy stated clearly: Entire Domain (general best), Exact Email (provider/transactional senders), TLD (heavy-handed, last resort)
- [ ] Read-Only -> review -> tune -> move-all loop documented as the recommended adoption pattern
- [ ] Scan History referenced as the recovery path for unexpected actions
- [ ] Cross-references from Manual Rule Creation screen ("Need help choosing a rule type? See walkthrough")

## Google Play Store Readiness (HOLD)

**Added**: February 15, 2026
**Status**: HOLD -- All GP items are on hold pending Product Owner prioritization
**Objective**: Features, configurations, and policy compliance needed to publish on the Google Play Store.

### Current App Assessment

### GP Detail Sections

Full detail for each GP item is preserved below for reference when these items are taken off hold.

#### GP-1: Application Identity and Branding

**Status**: [OK] Completed (Sprint 19, Issue #182)
**ADR**: ADR-0026 (Accepted)

Application rebranded to MyEmailSpamFilter with `com.myemailspamfilter` package. Firebase re-registration deferred until domain is registered (Issue #166).

---

#### GP-2: Release Signing and Play App Signing

**ADR**: ADR-0027 (Proposed)
**Estimated Effort**: ~4-6h

Configure production signing for release builds and enroll in Google Play App Signing.

**Tasks**:
- Generate production keystore (upload key)
- Configure `signingConfigs.release` in `build.gradle.kts`

#### GP-3: Android Manifest Permissions

**ADR**: ADR-0028 (Proposed)
**Estimated Effort**: ~4-6h

Declare all required permissions and implement runtime permission requests.

**Permissions Needed**: INTERNET, POST_NOTIFICATIONS (API 33+), RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED, WAKE_LOCK, FOREGROUND_SERVICE (API 34+), FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC (API 34+)

#### GP-4: Gmail API OAuth Verification (CASA)

**ADR**: ADR-0029 (Accepted)
**Estimated Effort**: ~40-80h (2-6 months elapsed)

Complete Google's three-tier verification for restricted Gmail scopes. CASA security assessment by approved third-party lab.

## Version History

| Version | Date | Summary |
|---------|------|---------|
| 5.14 | 2026-04-19 | Sprint 35 retro Category 13 addendum: F81 added as Sprint 36 carry-in (mandatory, not backlog -- Issue #242). Store release process documentation -- new `docs/STORE_RELEASE_PROCESS.md`, deprecate faulty `build-msix.ps1`, walk team through Partner Center upload. Triggered by Sprint 35 store-prep gap-finding. |
| 5.13 | 2026-04-19 | Sprint 35 store release prep: Bumped dev version 0.5.1.0 -> 0.5.2.0 (prod at 0.5.1.0 in store; 0.5.2.0 is next submission). Built signed MSIX (17.4 MB) at `mobile-app/build/windows/x64/runner/Release/my_email_spam_filter.msix`. Sprint 36 to bump dev to 0.5.3.0. |
| 5.12 | 2026-04-19 | Sprint 35 retrospective complete (Phase 7): Applied four of five proposed process improvements -- P1 Phase Auto-Advance Rule (CLAUDE.md item 7), P2 Standing Approval Inventory (Phase 3.7), P4 Model-Version Pitfalls appendix (CLAUDE.md), P5 Sprint Resume Pattern memory. Backlogged P3 as F80 (Phase Cheat Sheet, Issue #241). Closed Category 2 testing gap by adding Phase 5.1.1 step 2a (test-assertion sibling sweep for structural-data changes). Promoted Sprint 35 to Last Completed Sprint; added Sprint 35 row to Past Sprint Summary. |
| 5.11 | 2026-04-19 | Sprint 35 in progress: Removed BUG-S34-1 and F69 (both shipping in Sprint 35 PR #238). Added BUG-S35-1 (manual rule UI accepts duplicates -- Issue #239) discovered during F69 execution; cleanup required direct SQLite delete because UI couldn't disambiguate the duplicate from the bundled rule. Added F79 (Full WinWright E2E sweep) as HOLD item -- Issue #240, on-demand only, distinct from per-sprint conditional WinWright runs. |
| 5.10 | 2026-04-19 | Sprint 34 post-merge cleanup (pre-Sprint-35 backlog refinement): Removed F56, F73, F62, F72 from Next Sprint Candidates -- all four shipped in Sprint 34 (PR #236, see CHANGELOG 2026-04-18). Master plan now reflects only incomplete work for Sprint 35 planning. F69 (WinWright E2E) kept on list -- Sprint 34 shipped only the JSON test scripts (line 35 of CHANGELOG); execution work remains. |
| 5.9 | 2026-04-19 | Sprint 34 post-merge: Added BUG-S34-1 (stale `expect(resetResult.rules, 5)` assertion in default_rule_set_service_test.dart that escaped F73 review and broke develop after PR #236 merge). Carry-in for Sprint 35 per Harold (option 3). |
| 5.8 | 2026-04-16 | Sprint 33 completion: Removed F53, F54, F55, F65, F66 (features) and SEC-1b, SEC-14, SEC-19, SEC-22 (security). SEC-8 split -- HTTPS pinning done; SEC-8b tracks remaining IMAP pinning. SEC-11 split -- infrastructure done; SEC-11b tracks SQLCipher driver swap + migration. Added Sprint 33 to Past Sprint Summary. Updated Last Completed Sprint. |
| 5.7 | 2026-04-14 | Sprint 33 planning: Moved F61 to HOLD per user direction (partial doc refresh happens organically in Sprint 33 via ARCHITECTURE.md updates for SQLCipher/HelpScreen/DataDeletionService/PatternCompiler). |
| 5.6 | 2026-04-14 | Sprint 32 code review findings: Added SEC-1b (ReDoS runtime protection -- design work needed) and F72 (code hygiene cleanup -- emoji, MSVC guard, email message softening) from Phase 5.1.1 automated code review. |
| 5.5 | 2026-04-13 | Sprint 32 completion: Removed 10 completed security items (SEC-1/10/12/13/16/17/18/20/21/23). Added Sprint 32 to Past Sprint Summary. Updated Last Completed Sprint. |
| 5.4 | 2026-04-13 | Sprint 31 retrospective: Added F70 (Periodic Security Deep Dive template) and F71 (Periodic Architecture Deep Dive template) as HOLD items. |
| 5.3 | 2026-03-24 | Sprint 26: Marked F7, F36, F43, F44, F45, F47 complete. Removed F7/F36/F45/F47 detail sections. Added F48 (scan history enhancements). Updated Last Completed Sprint. |

| 5.0 | 2026-03-19 | Sprint 22: New backlog presentation format (priority-ordered, phase/platform fields, F# identifiers). Assigned F28-F38 to unnamed items. Moved Android/GP items to HOLD. Unholded H0 as F29. Removed old table format. |
| 4.1 | 2026-02-27 | Sprint 18 completion: removed completed items (#154, #141, #167, #168, #169), added F27 (Folder Selection UX), updated Last Completed Sprint and Past Sprint Summary |
| 4.0 | 2026-02-24 | Major restructure: added Maintenance Guide, unified Next Sprint Candidates list, removed completed feature details (F1/F2/F3/F5/F9/F10/F12/F17/F18), removed stale sections (Next Sprint TBD, Issue Backlog, Sprint 11/12 actions), integrated GP items into single priority view, condensed GP details |
| 3.3 | 2026-02-15 | Added Google Play Store Readiness section (GP-1 through GP-16, ADR-0026 through ADR-0034) |
| 3.2 | 2026-02-06 | Sprint 13 completed |
| 3.1 | 2026-02-01 | Added F12 to Sprint 13 |
| 3.0 | 2026-02-01 | Backlog refinement, reprioritized features |
