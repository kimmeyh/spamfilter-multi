description: "Deconstruct problems to fundamentals when conventional solutions feel wrong, costs seem fixed, or you hear 'that's how it's done.'"

When working on spamfilter-multi, invoke the first-principles skill to:

1. Challenge existing assumptions about how things "should" work
2. Break complex problems into fundamental components
3. Evaluate if current architecture/approach serves the project needs
4. Question "we have always done it this way" thinking
5. Propose novel solutions that may be simpler or more effective

This is especially useful for:
- Architectural decisions (should we add new adapter types?)
- Performance bottlenecks (is the scanning algorithm fundamentally inefficient?)
- Complex UI problems (is the current navigation structure optimal?)
- Email provider integration challenges (is IMAP/OAuth the right approach?)

Invoke the skill and follow it exactly as presented to you.
